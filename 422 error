About 422 error

While making a login system, I got encounted 422 error. 
422 Unprocessable Entity. 
I have encounted 422 error in last porject. 
At that time, 422 error was also big problem.
I had to solve 422 error and finally solved that error in two days.
But still I don't know how I did.
So I encounter error again and can't solve the problem.
That's why I try to know about 422 error in detail.
422 error is about "unprocessable entity".
It appears when if the server understands the request received and the syntax is correct, but the instructions in it have not been able to be processed.
With this error, http can't send its data to server becaise server's 'print' order is not printed.
Oh, I find the cause.
The correct word is 'inputId' but I wrote 'inpurId'.
I feel so futility.
I was so stressful because of this error but the cause is tiny one.
All of the causes are in myself, a computer never lies.
